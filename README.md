# Landing Page Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Overview

This project is a modern landing page template built with the latest web technologies. It includes:

- **Next.js 15**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- **React 19**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **shadcn/ui**: A collection of re-usable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- **Bun**: A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
