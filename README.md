# Landing Page Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It serves as a template for building modern, feature-rich landing pages.

## ✨ Features

- **Framework**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha)
- **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Package Manager**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, install the dependencies using Bun:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
