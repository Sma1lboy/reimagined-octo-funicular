# Project Summary

This project is a comprehensive boilerplate for a modern web application built with Next.js and TypeScript. It leverages the high-performance Turbopack bundler for rapid development.

The user interface is constructed using a rich set of pre-built components from Radix UI, complemented by `lucide-react` for icons, `recharts` for data visualization, and `sonner` for notifications. Styling is handled by the utility-first CSS framework, Tailwind CSS.

The project is configured with standard Next.js scripts for development, building, and linting, providing a solid foundation for building a feature-rich and scalable web application.
